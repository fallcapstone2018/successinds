                	<h4>Why Do An Internship?</h4>


                    <ul class="internlist">
                        <li><b>Real World Experience:</b> Joining a company as an intern gives you the opportunity to work hands on in a professional environment. As an intern you're not just there to get coffee or run errands but you're there to gain actual work experience. Internships help by teaching you more about the career path you are pursuing. Think of it like this – internships are a way to test drive possible jobs and explore different career options.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>5 Upper-Division Credits:</b> By joining an internship as a Digital Sciences student will grant you with 5 upper-division credits to go towards graduation.  This is a great incentive for students to gain experience while saving time in their studies.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Networking:</b> Internships often give you the opportunity to attend meetings and events. By interacting with professionals you gain new connections and learn how to communicate in a professional environment.</li>
                    </ul>





                  </div>

             <div class="internbox">



                	<h4>What To Look For?</h4>


                    <ul class="internlist">
                        <li><b>Career Path:</b> One of the key parts of an internship is getting to experience a specific role or industry so that you can decide whether it’s something you want to pursue after graduation. When picking an internship, look for one that offers you a truly hands-on experience. This will allow you to make well-informed decisions down the line and find the career path that works best for you.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Motivated Companies:</b> If you can thrive off the energy of others around you, you’ll naturally work harder and enjoy what you’re doing. By finding an internship at a company where employees are excited to come to work every day, you’ll naturally have a more enjoyable experience and will be more likely to choose a similarly positive work culture in the next phase of your career.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Resume Building:</b> Sharpening what you’re learning in your classes and actually applying it is key. However, try to pick up other skills that your professors aren’t necessarily teaching you. Identify programs or tools that are relevant in your industry and become an expert at them. Not only will you make yourself more marketable after the internship, you’ll set yourself apart as the “fast-learner” who is looking to add value fast!</li>

                	<h4>Interview for Internship</h4>


                    <ul class="internlist">
						            <li><b>Be Prepared:</b> You can prepare yourself for the interview by selecting appropriate interview attire beforehand (suits for business), researching the company, and preparing a list of questions you have for the interviewer. Bring a copy of your resume with you to the interview in case the interviewer does not have one on hand. Last but not least, practice answering sample interview questions to prepare yourself and gain confidence before the interview.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Good First Impression:</b> The interview is your opportunity to market yourself, and it is the reason you prepared and sent out all of those resumes and cover letters. Once you get the interview, it is your job to create an excellent first impression by being prompt, being yourself, attending to your nonverbal behavior (such as a firm handshake and maintaining eye contact throughout the interview), and by taking the first few minutes to develop a rapport with your interviewer.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Emphasize Skills & Accomplishments:</b> Focus on your skills and accomplishments, including high school/college coursework, volunteer and co-curricular activities, and your computer and language skills. Previous internships or work experiences are important as well as describing your transferable skills: communication, interpersonal, organization, strong analytical and problem solving, and more.</li>
